## A Traditional IT Overview
### How Websites Work
---
We want to use a network between ourselves (client) and a server. We will find a network and use it to route packets through it to the server, which will also reply.

For clients to find the server and vice versa, both clients and servers must have **IP Addresses**.

### What is a Server Composed Of?
---
- **Compute:** CPU
- **Memory:** RAM
- **Storage:** Data
	- Database: Store data in a structured way
- **Network:** Routers, switch, DNS server

### IT Terminology
---
>**Definition: Network**
>Cables, routers, and servers connected with each other

>**Definition: Router**
>A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!

>**Definition: Switch**
>Takes a packet and sends it to the correct/client on your network.

### Problems with Traditional IT Approach
---
- Need physical space for data center
- Costs for power supply, cooling, maintenance
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time
- Scaling is limited
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
- How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire)
Is there a way to externalize all this...?

**Yes!** (see below)

## What is Cloud Computing?
---
>**Definition: Cloud Computing**
>The **on-demand delivery** of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources.

**Features of Cloud Computing:**
- **Pay-as-you-go** pricing **(flexible pricing)**
- You can **provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources** you need **(flexible scaling)**
- You can access as many resources as you need, **almost instantly** **(speed)**
- Simple way to access **servers, storage, databases**, and a set of application services **(abstraction)**

So we are just using Amazon's data centers/hardware with a nice web interface.
(Gmail, Dropbox, Netflix is cloud computing!)

### The Deployment Models of the Cloud
---
>**Definition: Private Cloud**
>Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.

Use **Private Cloud** if you need:
- Complete control
- Security for sensitive applications
- Meet specific business needs
#### Public Cloud
>**Definition: Public Cloud**
>Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the Internet

(Advantages are listed above!)
(The Big 3: AWS, Azure, GCP)
#### Hybrid Cloud
>**Definition: Hybrid Cloud**
>Keeping some servers on premises and extending some capabilities to the Cloud

Use **Hybrid Cloud** if you need:
- Control over the sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
- Exposure to flexibility and cost-effectiveness of public cloud

### The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
---
#### 1. On-demand self service
- Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
#### 2. Broad network access
- Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
#### 3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
- Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
- Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
#### 4. Rapid Elasticity and Scalability
- Automatically and quickly acquire/dispose resources when required
#### 5. Measured service:
- Usage is measured, and users pay exactly for what they have used

### The Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
---
#### 1. Trade Capital Expenses (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
- Pay On-Demand: Don't own hardware
- Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
#### 2. Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale
